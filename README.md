# Gitlab Cache
## Getting started
I developed this tool for a previous employer and with their permission made it open source on Github! I removed all references to that specific employer upon their request. Please be aware that I'm the developer of the sole developer of this application but I'll happily add new features if someone finds this and finds a use in it.


## Why does this exist??
We primarily developed this since we couldn't get S3 storage to work for our specific Gitlab instance, one reason may have been zero trust, but there is numerous reasons why this may have happened. Anyways this supports at this moment primarily FTP shares. If you want me to add other storage options let me know.

## Will this get regular updates?
Maybe. Likely not. I'm busy with other things, but I might spend some time here and there tinkering with this, potentially because another job I had required a specific tool like this :).
